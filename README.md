# DPI Result App

I developed this app for the 3rd semester, Computer Technology, Dhaka Polytechnic Institute, for publishing results urgently for session 2020-21 (Prabidhan 2016). According to Prabidhan 2016, 1st to 3rd semester results should be published by the department (not the Bangladesh Technical Education Board).

### A Story

After developing this, I asked for the same work from other departments of Dhaka Polytechnic Institute. I unfortunately lost those contracts due to the result being published manually. I also tried some other polytechnics outside of Dhaka Polytechnic Institute (private polytechnics) in some of their departments, as I came to know they also published their results.

Although other departments of Dhaka Polytechnic Institute can accept my work for new students, unfortunately they were unable to due to the new Prabidhan, called Prabidhan-2022, which guided us not to publish any result by Polytechnic Institutes, and it should be published by BTEB (Bangladesh Technical Education Board).

So, I decided to redevelop with advanced features like subject credit and mark distribution setup, well previewing all inputted semester progress reports, a login system for other departments, etc., which should not be useful for other departments, though the app is not going to be used by them.

> However, I think that I should complete this app so that it would be shown to my portfolio or resume.

Now you can show a demo of the old version that was developed temporarily and urgently for only the 3rd semester, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Dhaka Polytechnic Institute.
