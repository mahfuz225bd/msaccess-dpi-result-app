# DPI Result App

I developed this app for 3rd semester, Computer Science, Dhaka Polytechnic Institute for publishing result urgently for session 2020-21 (Prabidhan 2016). According to Prabidhan 2016, 1st to 3rd semester result should be published by the department (not Bangladesh Technical Education Board).

### A Story About This App That I Wanna Share to You

After developing this, I asked for same work to others department of Dhaka Polytechnic Institute. I unfortunately lose those contract due to result was published manually. I also tried some other polytechnics out of Dhaka Polytechnic Institute (private polytechnics) of their some departments, as I came to know they also published there result.

Although, other departments of Dhaka Polytechnic Institute can be accepted my work for new students but unfortunately they were unable due to new Prabidhan, called Prabidhan-2022, where guided not to publish any result by Polytechnic Institutes and it should be published by BTEB (Bangladesh Technical Education Board).

So, I decided to re-develop with advanced features like subject credit and mark distribution setup, well previewing all inputted semester progress report, login system for other departments etc. which should not useful for other departments though the app not goanna use by them.

> However, I think that I should be completed this app so that it would be shown to my portfolio or resume.
